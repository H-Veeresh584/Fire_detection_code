üö® Project Update: Fire Alarm System using Arduino üö®

I'm excited to share my latest project‚Äîa Fire Alarm System built with Arduino! üî•

As part of my ongoing exploration into IoT and automation, I developed this system to detect smoke and fire hazards in real-time. The heart of the project is an Arduino board connected to a smoke sensor, which triggers an alarm to warn people of potential danger.

üîß Key Features:

Real-time Smoke Detection: Utilizes a smoke sensor to detect potential fire hazards.
Loud Alarm System: Activated immediately when smoke is detected.
Arduino Integration: Efficiently managed with Arduino programming and circuitry.
This project has been a fantastic hands-on experience in learning how to integrate sensors and create practical, life-saving solutions with simple technology. It‚Äôs amazing how affordable and accessible such projects can be using open-source hardware!

I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing my work with Arduino and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in the realm of safety automation.

Feel free to connect or reach out if you have any questions or are interested in the technical details!

Sure! Here's an example of a README content for your Fire Alarm System using Arduino project that you can add to your GitHub repository:

Fire Alarm System using Arduino
This is a simple Fire Alarm System developed using Arduino. The system detects smoke levels in the environment using a MQ-2 Smoke Sensor and triggers an alarm if smoke levels exceed a safe threshold. It is an excellent project for learning about sensors, alarms, and real-time detection using Arduino.

üö® Features
Smoke Detection: Detects smoke or fire using the MQ-2 sensor.
Alarm System: Activates a buzzer whenever smoke levels exceed the set threshold.
Arduino-Based: Easy-to-implement solution using Arduino programming and basic electronic components.
Simple & Effective: Cost-efficient and functional for small-scale fire detection systems.
üîß Components Required
To build the Fire Alarm System, you will need the following components:

Arduino Uno or compatible board
MQ-2 Smoke Sensor
Buzzer
LED (Optional for visual alert)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard (optional)
üìÑ Circuit Diagram
You can find the circuit diagram in the repository or in the documentation to help set up your hardware connections.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup
Hardware Connections:

Connect the MQ-2 Smoke Sensor to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
Connect the Buzzer to the appropriate pin on the Arduino.
Optionally, connect an LED for visual feedback.
Software:

Download and install the Arduino IDE if you don't already have it.
Open the fire_alarm.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Upload Code:

Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Test the System:

Once uploaded, open the serial monitor to check if the sensor is reading the correct smoke levels.
Test the alarm by introducing smoke to the sensor (a small amount of smoke, like from a match, can trigger the alarm).
üíª Code Explanation
The code uses the MQ-2 sensor to measure the smoke levels in the environment. When the smoke level exceeds a predefined threshold, the buzzer is activated to signal a potential fire hazard. The threshold can be adjusted in the code based on your specific requirements.

MQ-2 Sensor: The sensor‚Äôs analog output is used to detect the smoke concentration.
Buzzer: The buzzer is activated when smoke levels exceed the threshold.
The code also features a simple method to calibrate the sensor, ensuring accurate readings over time.

üìú Code Structure
fire_alarm.ino: Main Arduino code that controls the functionality of the fire alarm system.
libraries/: Any required libraries for the sensor (if applicable).
